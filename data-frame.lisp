A 'strand' is a 'named column' in R.

It consists of:
1. a NAME (currently a symbol, but probably better as a string?),
2. DATA, a vector containing the data (element type and values not preset),
3. the ELEMENT-TYPE (where T is the universal type).

You cannot rely on UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE (U-A-E-T in the sequel)
because most implementations are lazy."

;; means of having a key to identify variables from the same observation
;; thereby not necessarily allowing a mixture of variable lengths.  

;; The question is not whether such a structure is useful, it is more

;;; Pascal clarifies for me:

;; Variables don't have types. [*] Values have types. So searching for all 
;; variables of certain types is not very meaningful. You may rather want 
;; to search for all values of certain types. 

;; You cannot do this out of the box. However, with structs and classes, 
;; you can define constructors or initializers that store the created 
;; objects in tables. (If these are weak tables, like weak hash tables, you 
;; don't even prevent them from being garbage collected.) 

;; Pascal 

;; [*] You can declare/declaim types for variables, but this may be ignored 
;; by a Common Lisp implementation, and is not recorded in a way that could 
;; be queried, at least not in a portable way. If you want to be able to 
;; query variable types, you may have to implement your own mechanism for 
;; registering such types, but they are then not enforced by the Common 
;; Lisp implementation.
